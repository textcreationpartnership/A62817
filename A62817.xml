            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>IT is not a time now to Dispute but Act, and that vigorous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly too, or <hi>England's</hi> lost. POPERY, that Enemy to God, by setting up <hi>Idols;</hi> to Christ, by its New found <hi>Mediators;</hi> to the Holy Ghost, by putting a <hi>Pope</hi> in his place; to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, by its <hi>Legends</hi> and <hi>corrupt Traditions;</hi> to Reason, by its imposed <hi>Absurdities;</hi> to common Sense, by its most foolish but most <hi>idolized Transubstantiation;</hi> to all tender dissenting Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences by <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Faggot;</hi> and to all Civil Government that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to be subject to it, by <hi>Plots, Assassinations</hi> and <hi>horrid Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacrees,</hi> its usual and notorious steps to Worldly Advancement. This monstrous <hi>Popery,</hi> this common Enemy to Mankind, that hath so often contrived our Ruin, and several times been at the very point of effecting it, has once more attempted us, and with
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56489:2"/>that Violence and Design that it looks like the last time: Nay, the great Sticklers of it are got within our Works, and promise themselves the Guarrison, because they say they have Friends in Disguise among us. 'Tis true, they have lost some Men in the Attempt, but they are not much daunted at that; for the whole <hi>Papal</hi> World they bragg have conspired their Success, and the Air Rings with the Thousands of Masses that are daily said for the Prosperity of the Design, as if their Intention were to convert the World, and not to <hi>Kill</hi> the King, <hi>Garble</hi> the Parliament, <hi>Shamble</hi> all good and sober Protestants of every Party, <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Plunder</hi> Citie, and finally, <hi>Change</hi> the Government and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Kingdom, which is the <hi>Plot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor will the more impudent of them deny the thing in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, but much the contrary, insulting to us with <hi>Tertullians Impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vimus omnia</hi> against the old <hi>Pagans,</hi> We fill your Courts, your Armies, your Navies, it must take, you can't avold it; 'tis a just Cause to extirpate Hereticks Root and Branch.</p>
            <p>But one (and may be the worst) part of the Plot has fail'd them, they resolv'd to surprize you, to make a Night Work of it, to let you and yours never see day more (for such Deeds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Darkness) as they did in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> in those most Bloody Massacrees of poor harmless <hi>Protestants.</hi> But God, the infinitely good and gracious God, that hath alwayes watcht over this poor Island (an hundred times design'd to destruction) and whose Eye pierceth through the Secrets of men, hath notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the Greatness, as well as multitude of our Sins (not to be equalled by any thing but his Patience and Compassion) dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered this impious, Conspiracy we hope too early for the Plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Purpose; he has beaten up our Quarters, and given us the Alarm, if we will take; methinks we should, where the Noise of Fire and Sword is in our Ears; when we cannot walk the Streets without Danger of being stabbed, nor sleep in our Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses for fear of being burned, witness the dreadful Fire at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> the Fire of <hi>Southwark,</hi> and that the other day of <hi>Limehouse,</hi> where three poor Souls were burned quick, to say nothing of forty Attempts they have made in other places. To which let me add the Design in general of Massacreeing all the best Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56489:2"/>in the Kingdom, begun and amply confirmed in the most bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Murder of that Worthy Knight and Judicious Magistrate Sir <hi>Edmundberry Godfry;</hi> and here I must stay a while. Murder is a great Sin against God and our Neighbour; but alas! what induced them to it here? Sir <hi>Edmundberry Godfry</hi> was one of the Mildest Men to these Bloody <hi>Papists</hi> that was in Commission for the Peace; for though he hated Arbitrary Power and <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,</hi> as the Cause or Effect of it, yet a Man for a due Liberty to all sober People pretending Tenderness of Conscience, and saved them from many a Pinch on that score, hoping, as many more did, that after an hundred years Experience, Intermarria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Conversation and large Indulgence, they were grown wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, if not more Christian than to cut their Way to Government through Blood, and Kill for Religion (pardon me the use of the word about <hi>Popery,</hi> that has nothing of Religion but the Name) but Gratitude restrains not men of this stamp, their Principle knows no Kindred, no Obedience, no Obligation that stands in the way of their conspired Dominion. Well but was it that they would be revenged of him, for having Courage (Courage I say, as the World goes) to take Depositions upon Oath of their Devilish Plot? But where's the Crime here, which can properly give their Act the term of <hi>Revenge,</hi> since Examination is neither Judgment nor Execution? even a Saint is not injur'd to be examin'd, much less a <hi>Papist:</hi> Innocency gets on Tryal, if falsly accused; but that's not the Case; for Truth seek; no Corners, nor yet Ditches to lay a Murder'd Man in after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Strangled him in a House for the purpose: What then can be the plain <hi>English</hi> of the business but this, that they concluded, his former Kindness thus abused would forever disingage him for the future; and that since he could not be prevail'd upon to stifle the Evidence he had and might yet have produced (for he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd to some, he had been both tamper'd with &amp; menac'd) they would strangle him; which is such a Demonstration of their Folly as well Malice hath given of the whole to be true, that none can now deny it to be a Plot but those that are of it, or will lose by the Discovery.</p>
            <p>But some say, <hi>He Killed himself.</hi> That's a likely Business in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56489:3"/>for what I pray? a <hi>sober, Charitable, judicious Man.</hi> O But he was Melancholly, that is, he was a serious man; but why now more Melancholly than ever, because he had wronged the innocent <hi>Papists</hi> Is that it? Where's the Wrong? is it, That he heard what Persons upon Oath declared of the most horrid Conspiracy that ever was on foot in the world; but the Murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Son of God? but be this Deposition true or false, it was his Duty and Place to take it, he was Sworn to do it, it was a great and the best part of his Office; he had deserv'd a Plotter's Punishment to have refused the thing. Here is no Virulency, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borning of Evidence, Condemning or Murdering them in all this: Where's the Sin then that should trouble his Conscience? But they that will Murder, will Lye to cover it.</p>
            <p>Besides, 'tis plain that he was strangled, and his neck broke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore stab'd, because he could neither strangle himself nor break his Neck after he was Stab'd through his Heart, nor Stab him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self after he was Strangled, and his Neck broke: moreover had he been Stab'd before dead or soon after, Blood would have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared on the Hilt of his Sword on which he lay, or on the Ground, it being a dry place, or on his Cloaths; but no Blood was to be seen; and when the Sword was drawn out of his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy which his Murderers put in to paliate the Butchery, nothing issued from him but a dark Water, as is usual where Blood is coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated, as his doubtless was before he was Stab'd: for we are of Opinion there was a good time betwixt Strangling and Stabing him, and that the latter was upon great deliberation, and that on purpose to hide the Actors, and cast the Murder upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. O Lord God! that ever Men should be so much the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Devil; as first to Murder, then charge it upon the Innocent Soul Murdered. But the Devil was ever a Fool, and so in this. For besides what we have observed, this further is to be said, they that killed him would have us think 'twas himself, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause neither Cloathes, nor Money, nor Rings were taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>away. True, but though they that are concerned in the Plot wanted neither his Cloathes, nor Money, nor Rings, to carry it on, yet they took what they wanted, and they wanted what they took with a witness, and that was his Pocket-Book of Depositions
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56489:3"/>and Examinations, which puts it out of doubt that they that were so much concerned in them, both Murdered him and took it; for none can think that <hi>Father Coniers,</hi> the D. of <hi>Norfolks</hi> Consessor taking the Air over Hedge and Ditch to <hi>Primrose</hi> Hill, dropt just upon him and pickt his Pockets of the Book: Well, but <hi>why may he not have Hang'd himself, and his Kindred to save his Estate Stak'd him afterwards, and sarry him thither?</hi> This is deadly cunning; but why was his Pocket Book only wanting, wherein the Plotters were concern'd? Tricks won't do here: furthermore, why did they not keep his Gold, Silver, and Rings that were found in his Pocket, but expose them? why not strip him in some degree, make wound in his Sword Arm, and hack, bend or break his Sword that it might look like Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery? But last of all, why should they carry him out exactly as he used to go quite drest, and want a Band, especially since they were so punctual as to take his Sword, Belt, Gloves and Stick with them. He went out in the Morning with a great lac'd Band, none was found, as well as the Book of Examinations, of that we have already spoke; for the Band 'tis a plain case they Strangled him, and being a long Neckt Man, and wearing an high strong Collar, he strugling to save himself, and they striving to dispatch him that way, the Band was torn in the Fray, and to have let it go so, had been to have tould the Story too plainly, that is, that the Man was Strangled to Death by Violence, &amp; that the stab of his own Sword was an after-trick to cover the business.</p>
            <p>Thus this poor Gentleman, but worthy and brave Patriot, ended his dayes by the Assassinating Hands of <hi>Papists,</hi> whose Butchery made him the Common Martyr of his Religion and Country, and his Death is to us the Earnest of their Cruelty; in him they have Massacree'd us all, we must take it to ourselves, and can no more be unconcerned in his Death, than dismteressed in the Cause of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Plot is opened, the Tragedy is begun, our Wines are frighted, our Children cry;</hi> no man is sure of his Life a day; the choice is only, what Death we shall dye, whether be Stabbed, Strangled or Burned. This Consternation and Insecurity must needs ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct all Commerce, scare people from following their lawful
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56489:4"/>Occasions, deter all Officers of Justice from their Duty, and in sine, dissolve humane Society, and reduce the World into its first Chaos.</p>
            <p>For the Lord's sake let us consider our Condition, let us all turn to the Lord wita unfeigned Repentance, let us look and cry to him for Help, that he who has discovered would confound this Bloody Conspiracy, and shew Mercy, and bring us Deliverance, that we may yet see his Salvation, and serve him all the dayes of our Lives; and in order to our Security, these things are earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly requested of you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Take effectual Care to preserve the King; they say and we believe he is not for their turn; we would not have him for his sake and ours: In order to this, pray find out the <hi>Achitophels,</hi> the Dangerous men about him; you know who they are; Befree and bold, prize your time, the Conjuncture is great.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Vote an Address to the King to Banish all <hi>Irish Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi> out of the Army, Navy and Kingdom by such a Day, and all <hi>Papists</hi> out of the City of <hi>London,</hi> whose gross Ignorance and Base Desperateness renders them the fittest men for Assassina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Besides, it is a shame that the Children and Kindred of <hi>Irish</hi> Rebels, nay some of them the very men themselves that were Actors in that horrid Massacree in the year 1640. about thirty seven years since, in which above Three Hundred Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand <hi>Protestants</hi> were Murder'd in the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> without regard to Age or Sex, should be employ'd either in the <hi>English</hi> Army or Navy; but more scandalous is it, that St. <hi>James's</hi> should be their Head Quarters, and the <hi>Park</hi> turned into an <hi>Irish Walk.</hi> What do so many <hi>Irish Papists</hi> Teigs and Rebels do swarming there? No Good to be sure; their Parts, Courage and Skill can invite no man of any to entertain them; it must on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be their Ignorance and Cowardly Cruelty which make them Instruments of Mischlef, and fit to be used by those that love foul play. But that poor dissenting <hi>Protestants</hi> should be daily mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted and pilledged for the sake of their peaceable Consciences, whilst Teigs and <hi>Irish</hi> Rebels go by whole droves under the Nofe
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56489:4"/>of King and Duke in their Royal Park, and Walks of Pleasure, is almost insupportable. Is this to maintain <hi>Protestant</hi> Religion, and discountenance <hi>Popery? Expede Herculem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> For God's sake call for the Plot, look thoroughly and strictly into it; fear not favour no man; <hi>Fiat Justitia:</hi> But fear God, do what you do as in his Presence, to whom you must render an Accompt. 'Tis the great Action of your Life, discharge your Trust, and quit yourselves now like Men. This has been the perpetual Troubler of our <hi>Protestant-Israel;</hi> as you would see God with Comfort, and secure your Posterity from civil and spiritual Tyranny, slip not this Opportunity God has so wonderfully cast into your hands; be not found Despifers of his Providence, neither be you dareless of fearful of improving it; Now or Never: had they you on this Lock, and at this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, you could not have so well done before, they have now made easie and necessary for you to do; and what before you scarcely might do, is now become your Duty. Be not cheated by a Sacrifice; let not the Lives of two or three Plotters be the Ransome of the rest, or your Satisfaction; 'tis not Blood but Secarity, prospect future Safety, an Eternal Prevention of the like Miseries for the future; otherwise we shall only sit down with the Peace and Joy of Fools, and fat our selves Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with more Security against their next Slaughter. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Raise the Trane-Bands, and let them be put not so much as into the hands of men <hi>Popishly</hi> affected, for those men that would pull off the Visard in case <hi>Popery</hi> prevailed, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise keep their Credit by not discovering themselves, are the most dangerous to be Trusted; I fear <hi>Popery</hi> thus entring more than any other way: examine the Counties well, for some of base Principles are entrusted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Let there be Power given to raise Auxiliaries, that such honest <hi>Protestant</hi>-Gentlemen as are willing at their own

            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> and more especially, Let all the Laws in force against immorallity be speedily and effectually executed: 'Tis <hi>Sin</hi> which is the <hi>Disease</hi> and <hi>Shane</hi> of the Nation; we have forgotten God, and cast his <hi>Law</hi> behind us, and we deserve nor this beginning of Deliverance: Our Pleasures have been our Gods, and to them we bow, and have little or no Religion at Heart; therefore 'tis that Iniquity abounds, and in that variety too, and to such a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree as no Kingdom can parallel. Blush, O Heavens, and be Astonished O Earth, a People loved of God, and so often saved by his wonderfull Providences, are become the <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon,</hi> the <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> of the World. Let us Repent in Dust and Ashes; let us turn to God from the bottom of our hearts, with the servent Love and good Works of our martyr'd An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors, or their Life, Doctrine and Death will rise up in Judgment against us, and God will yet suffer their and our Enemies to swallow us up quick. And be assured, as Looseness and Debauchery were design'd by the Papists as a State trick to dispose the minds of the People to receive, at least suffer Popery (that to say true cannot live with better Company) so the discouragement of it, and cherishing of all vertuous persons, with a serious and hearty prosecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56489:6"/>on of the forementioned <hi>Proposals,</hi> will stop, and in time wear it out of the Kingdom; for Popery scars nothing more then <hi>Light, Inquiry,</hi> and <hi>Sober living.</hi> Hear us, we beseech you, for Jesus Christ's sake; take heart, we will never leave you, don't you'eave us: Provide for the King, provide for the People; for God alone knows when we he down, if we shall ever rise, or when we go forth, if we shall ever return. Remember the Massacree of <hi>Paris,</hi> in which so many thousands fell, and with them that brave Admiral <hi>Coligny,</hi> infamy enough one would think to shame the Party, did they know such a thing; but instead of that, 'twas Meritorious, yea 'tis subject of Triumph; look into the <hi>Vatican</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> and among the other rare Feats perform'd by Christian Kings against Infidels; this Massacree of <hi>Paris</hi> now about 100. years old, is to be found, and so carefull was the Designer to do it to the life, that he has not omitted to shew us how the Noble Admiral was flung dead out of the Window into the Street, to be used as people use Cats &amp; Dogs in Protestant Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, but good enough for an Heretick, whom the worse they use, the better they are. But to shew they own the <hi>Plot,</hi> and glory in the <hi>Action,</hi> and for fear one not read in the Story should take <hi>Coligny</hi> for <hi>Jezabel,</hi> they have gallantly explained the Action upon the Piece, and writ his name at large.</p>
            <p>Put there is a Cruelty nearer Home, no less barbarous, the <hi>Irish</hi> Massacree in 1640. nay, it exceeded: first in number, there were above Three hundred thousand Murder'd: Next, in that no Age or Sex was spared: And lastly in the manner of it, 'twas general throughout the Kingdom; and as they were more Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage, so more Cruel, they spared not either Sick or Lying in Women; they kill'd poor Infants, and innocent Children, tossing some upon their Swords, Skeens, and other Instruments of Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty; flinging others into Rivers, and taking several by the Legs, dasht their Brains out against Walls or Rocks. O Lord God avenge this Innocent Blood, it still crys: But that these Actors of this Tragedy, or their Bloody-minded Off-spring should swarm in <hi>England,</hi> be Pensioners here, as if they were the old Souldiers of the Queen, men of Eighty eight, Cripples of Loyalty, laid up for their good Services, and St <hi>James's</hi> their
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56489:6"/>Hospital; this scandalizes us: we think them the worst Cattel of their Country, and pray that there may be an exchange, that you would prohibit their Importation instead of more usefull Beasts. For the bloody Massacree of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> you have it at large described by Sir <hi>S. Morland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But we must never forget the horrid murder of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, and of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth of <hi>France,</hi> our Kings renowned Grand-Father. And would to God our King would consider that all his Humanity to them can never secure him from their stroak; they were both better Catholicks, and yet both Assassinated; the first a bred <hi>Papist,</hi> yet because he would not Murder all the <hi>Hugonots</hi> or <hi>Protestants</hi> of his Kingdom, and his known best Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, they did as much for him. The last was their Convert, all they seem'd to desire of him, and all they can expect from our King, yet how did they use him? they did twice assassinate him, and the last time kill'd him. What security then can any Prince promise to himself from men that make not the profession of the same Religion, a protection to them that own it, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on humors or suspicion; of their own, or to introduce another Person or Family, more immediately under their influence, and disposed to their turn, will make no scruple of killing him? What Slaves are Kings with such men, and under such a R<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ligdon? let not the mildness of our Prince be thus abused; show yourselves his great and best Council in this Conjucture, and deliver him from these men of ingratitude: Men that will never be content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but with that which they must not have; of such Qualifications, that what may be esteem'd Ambition, Revenge or Interest in all other parties, is a settled Principle with them. This their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Doctors tell us, and to excite men in the persuit of it, they declare all such Acts more then ordinarily meritorious: But what hold can we have of such men that have no Conscience? this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion looks hard, and besides their practice (for if that were alwayes to cast the Scale, it would go hard with many <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants</hi> too; 'tis their avowed Doctrine, they Glory in it and maae it our reproach to have any such thing. I say, that <hi>Papists</hi> have no Conscience, or no use of Conscience in their Religion, which is the same thing; for what is Conscience but the <hi>Judgment a man makes in himself of religious matters according to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56489:7"/>given him of God;</hi> But this is out of Doors with them, 'its Heresie; <hi>Authority</hi> rules them, not <hi>Truth;</hi> as if a man were to be credited for his <hi>Age,</hi> not his <hi>Reason. Conscience</hi> is a dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick and private Judge, dangerous to the <hi>Chair,</hi> the <hi>Pope,</hi> for it rather hinders then helps subjection, the less there be of it, the sooner men turn Captives to their Mysteries: So that putting out the Eyes of our Mind, and a Blind before our Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, best fit us for Popish Religion: as if Religion had not so great an Enemy as Reason, not Faith as knowledge. 'Tis strange that a man cannot be a Papist without renouncing the only di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction of a Man from a Beast: Therefore it is we pray to be secured from Papists, because at best they unman us, and are not their own men. 'Tis true, as <hi>Protestants</hi> don't alwayes live up to their good Principles, neither do Papist, to their bad Ones, Breding, good Humor, Generosity (and a better Principle they know not of) may byase some of them to worthy things, but this is not according to their Principles; for if they will be true to them, they must abandon choice, and obey their Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, Right or wrong, and every immorality he commands is duty upon Damnation; the more contrary to their Reason, and averse to their Nature, the greater the Merit; Hesitation is weakness; Dissent, Schism; Opposition, Heresle; the Consequence, Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: From this Religion, <hi>O Lord God deliver us, O King and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament protect us:</hi> 'Tis your duty to God and your obligation to the people.
